  description: "This delicious leafy plant enhances any salad with its peppery flavor. Arugula, as it’s known here in the U.S., is also called rocket in Britain and France, and rucola in Italy. To grow arugula at home, plant seeds in late fall and early spring to harvest by early summer. It can grow in very light shade, but it thrives in the sun, which will produce a stronger peppery flavor. Older arugula leaves will also have a much stronger flavor than newer ones; its flowers are edible when used as a garnish. Arugula is a flavorful plant that makes a great pizza topping added at the end of baking, and is simply delicious in salads and sandwiches. It is important to buy fresh-cut arugula, with firm and tender green leaves. You should only wash arugula in cool water before cooking; otherwise it can be cleaned, patted dried and stored in the fridge up to four days.",

In French cuisine, celery is sautéed with carrots and onions to create a mirepoix, or aromatic base. In Italian, Spanish, and Creole style cooking, a sofrito is made with celery, onions, and bell peppers. The entire vegetable is completely edible; in addition to the stalks, the seeds are used as a seasoning, the leaves can be tossed in a salad, and the root — also called celeriac — is often roasted or pureed. Celery is a biennial vegetable, meaning it has a normal life cycle of two years, and belongs to the umbelliferae family, whose other members include carrots, parsley and fennel. Choose tight and compact celery that looks crisp and snaps easily when pulled apart. The leaves should be pale to bright green in color. The outer ribs will have tougher stringy fibers, which can be peeled off with a vegetable peeler. Cut celery for immediate cooking, because it can wilt quickly. One way to revitalize celery is by adding moisture to the vegetable and placing in the refrigerator until it regains its crispness.",

Store fennel in the fridge for up to 3 days and keep submersed in water to retain its moisture and texture.

Fennel bulbs can be chopped, julienned, or diced for cooking, or thinly sliced across the bulb with a mandolin and used as a fresh ingredient in salads.

  description: "When chiles reach their piquant peak, it is a sure sign of late summer. Hot peppers need a long, warm growing period during which they develop capsaicin, the chemical compound responsible for their spiciness. The production of capsaicin is a trait that probably evolved to discourage mammals from eating the fruits. In the wild, birds, which are attracted to peppers’ bright colors but unaffected by their heat, generally spread their seeds. Despite the chile’s peppery pursuit to deter us, humans are pleased by their pungency. In fact, we have been very effective distributors of pepper seed. Capsicums are native to the Americas and were one of the first crops to be domesticated here thousands of years ago. After Columbus was introduced to the pepper, he brought its seeds to Spain; the crop subsequently made its way to the rest of Europe, Southeast Asia and India. Today, peppers pervade many cultures’ cuisines in various forms. Chile powder is one of the world’s most popular spices. The piquancy of peppers is measured using Scoville heat units, named after the man who first invented a way to gauge capsaicin content. On the scale, bell peppers rate zero, jalapeños around 5,000, and Habaneros around 500,000. Pepper spray, the active ingredient of which is a capsaicinoid compound, rates 5,000,000 units. In the United States, peppers with low Scoville ratings are more popular crops than their fiery relatives, but hotter peppers seem to be gaining employment in our culinary culture.",

Due to its rapid maturation (many varieties are ready for harvest in a matter of weeks), the radish is a popular plant for children’s gardens.

In American cuisine, the root adds bulk and flavor to stews or can be found mashed with carrots or baked in pastries.

Salsify is popular for its taste and is often referred to as the “oyster plant” as it possesses a similar sweet, earthy flavor. Salsify is also grown for pollination purposes as the purple flowers tend to attract beneficial insects. To prepare, salsify must be peeled and then covered in vinegar or lemon juice so as not to become discolored. Once the outer layer is removed, however, salsify can be blanched, sauteed, or roasted. Salsify is often pureed and can add an interesting flavor to any traditional dish, like soup or mashed potatoes. When purchasing, look for medium sized roots.
