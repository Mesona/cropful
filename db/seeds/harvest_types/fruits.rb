description: "Before there was the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad, there was the original apple: a rotund, crispy fruit, borne by the apple tree. There are over 7,500 cultivars of apples, most of which are harvested for eating while some are specifically cultivated for cooking and making into cider. The more modern, commercially popular cultivars tend to have a uniform shape and sweeter taste than older varieties. Apples depend on cross-pollination and growers must use pollinators, like honeybees, to develop the fruit. A mature apple tree can yield between 88-440 pounds of apples a year. Throughout September and October, some local farms are also open for you-pick apple fun.",

description: "The apricot is native to a continental climate region with cold winters, though it can grow in Mediterranean climates very well. Apricot trees are slightly more cold-hardy than peach trees, but they tend to flower very early, meaning spring frost often kills the flowers. One of the most sought-after local apricots, the Blenheim or Royal apricot, was introduced to California in the 1880s, and by the 1920s the variety dominated a thriving dried apricot industry, blanketing the Santa Clara Valley. Most of the original Blenheim orchards have been paved over, but a few farmers still grow the intensely flavorful variety.",

Known for being quite juicy and crisp, Asian pears are mildly sweet and delicate in flavor. Their crispiness makes for a refreshingly simple dessert when chilled, then peeled and sliced, or add them to a salad for a sweet crunch. Unlike their European counterparts, Asian pears are ready to eat when picked. Though they are hard when ripe, they will bruise easily. They keep well under refrigeration far longer than most other fruit. Look for aromatic fruit in late summer through early winter.",

classification: "fruit",
description: "Avocados are thought to have originated in Mexico, though their exact genesis is unknown. Like corn, figs, sugar cane and other ancient crops, the avocado is a cultigen: a species domesticated so long ago (around 7,000 years in the case of avocados) that has undergone such dramatic changes that its wild ancestor cannot be determined. Whatever the original source, most agree that cultivated avocados originate from three different regions: Mexico, Guatemala, and West India. The rich fruits were first introduced to California in the late 1800s and have steadily grown in popularity. By far the most prevalent variety of avocado is Hass (which, contrary to popular belief, rhymes with glass). The Hass variety originated from a seedling purchased from avocado pioneer A.R. Rideout by a postman named Rudolph Hass. According to the California Avocado Commission website, “He planned to graft another variety on it, but when repeated grafts didn’t take he planned to cut the tree down. Fortunately for avocado lovers everywhere, Hass’s children talked him out of it. They preferred the taste of the tree’s fruit to that of the Fuerte, the predominant variety and industry standard in those days.” Hass patented the new variety in 1935 and made a deal with nurseryman Harold Brokaw: Brokaw would propagate and promote the variety and give 25% of the proceeds back to Hass. Brokaw’s success in his venture is astounding; about 95% of the avocados grown in California today can be traced back to Hass’s “Mother Tree.” In the 1950s, Harold’s nephew Hank and his wife Ellen decided, for fun, to start their own small nursery. The subtropical nursery stock they grew was in high demand, and Brokaw Nursery soon expanded to be the largest distributor of subtropical stock in California. Will Brokaw, Hank and Ellen’s son, manages farmers’ market sales of fresh fruit for Brokaw Nursery. He says his parents foresaw the “avocadoization” of California, a phenomenon that began in the 1970s. At the farmers’ market, shoppers will find a diversity of avocados. Bacon, Fuerte, Pinkerton, Zutano, Gwen, Reed, Nabal, Esther, Lamb Hass, Jim, Mexicola, Stewart and, of course, Hass varieties are available most of the year, though each variety has its own season. The varieties vary more in characteristics like seed size, peel-ability and oil content than they do in flavor.",

It is technically an “aggregate fruit,” which means it forms from one flower, but is made up of multiple smaller fruits called drupes. While blackberries are most often cooked as part of a dessert, they can also be used to make wine. Bees like the nectar of the flowers, and they make great honey. Blackberries are also nutritional powerhouses that rank high among antioxidant-rich fruits. Although their seeds can get stuck in your teeth, try not to spit them out. They contain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.",

description: "Ever wonder which berry is prominently displayed on the famous Knott’s Berry Farm sign? It’s a boysenberry. This purple-red fruit is a cross between a blackberry and raspberry and was first developed by a farmer named Rudolph Boysen in the 1920s. When reports of his strange, new berry reached the USDA, Walter Knott, a famous berry expert, was hired to further investigate and a few years later, in 1935, he began cultivating the fruit commercially, selling them whole and as preserves. Boysenberries are juicy and sweet, like a blackberry, but can have a tart aftertaste, especially when not fully ripe. They require full sun and shelter from the wind and, like other trailing vine fruits, they require regular pruning. When selecting boysenberries, look for ones that are plump. Boysenberries don’t keep long, but should be stored in the refrigerator in a shallow, covered container. Do not wash them until just before eating, as the moisture can hasten spoilage.",

It is prized for the essential oils in the outer rind (flavedo), which are especially fragrant and believed to have antibiotic properties, as well as its pith (albedo), which is often candied for succade and used in baking, particularly around the winter holidays. Another popular use is infused vodka. The pulp-less, many-tentacled Buddha’s Hand citron is almost all peel, with a pith that is not bitter, unlike most citrus fruits.

The fruit is shaped like a much smaller, more oval orange and it is hardier than its citrus kin, preferring hot weather but able to withstand low temperatures and frosts. Kumquats grow on small evergreen shrubs that bear between 30 to 50 fruits. The trees can also be hydrophytic, which means they can grow in aquatic environments, and the fruits will drift towards the shore during harvest season. Kumquats are generally eaten whole; the outer, sweet rind is edible and offers a contrast to the tangy, inner flesh. The fruit is also often candied or preserved in salt or sugar. Some mixologists are even swapping kumquats for olives for a more modern twist on the martini.",

While these may be the most recognizable olives in the bunch, there are actually thousands of known cultivars and in Italy alone, over 300 types are produced. With such abundance and popularity, it is no surprise that this fruit is one of the most written about plants in all literature. It appears in many classics, from the Odyssey to the Bible, and is often used a symbol for power, peace, and wisdom. Beyond being the star of print, stage, and screen, the olive tree is also known as one of the heartiest, drough-resistant plants. It can live a very long time if pruned and cared for properly, and some of the trees in the Mediterranean have been around for several centuries. Olive trees prefer drier soils and warmer climates and as such, they are currently cultivated in the temperate regions of the Mediterranean, Chile, Australia, South Africa, and California. The olive fruit, which is the part of the plant used for oil, is harvested during the fall season. Farmers use an array of techniques, such as limb-shaking and the tong-shaped oliviera, to safely remove the fruit. It then must be fermented and cured before being considered “palatable.” While the oil is most commonly used for cooking purposes, it can also be found in medicinal teas and is not being researched as a possible renewable energy source.",

description: "Pears have been grown in California since the Gold Rush. The fruit originated in Eastern Europe or Asia Minor, and it has been cultivated since prehistoric times. Members of the family Rosaceae, pears have many sweet edible kin, among them apples, loquats, strawberries, almonds, apricots, cherries, nectarines, peaches and plums. Pyrus communis, the classic European pear, gained popularity in Italy and France during the Middle Ages, and the number of varieties steadily increased. In the 1600s, a Massachusetts company ordered pear seeds from a British seed company, and their cultivation in the US began. Western coastal states now produce most of America’s pears, primarily Bartlett and Bosc varieties.",

The fruit was created in the 20th century by a plant geneticist name Floyd Zaiger who is also responsible for the over 20 pluot varietals that currently exist.  The skin of the fruit resembles that of a plum and the flesh is juicy and sweet in flavor due to a high sugar content.  ",

description: "Like its apple and pear relatives, the quince tree (Cydonia oblonga) originated in Central Asia. The fruit resemble very firm, bright green, short-necked pears. Quince is known for its distinctive floral aroma, but the raw fruit is rarely eaten because it is astringent, sour and gritty, even when ripe. Quince is suitable for many cooked preparations and will turn reddish-pink when cooked. Membrillo, a firm paste made of cooked quince, is a traditional accompaniment to Spanish Manchego cheese. Quince can also be used for jams and jellies, as in the Portuguese quince jam known as marmalada. A few quince slices added to apple pie lend a fragrant, perfumed flavor. Look for quince from September through November.",

description: "Although the leaves of this plant are toxic and the stalks are tart, some sugar and heat easily mellow its pungent flavors and make it a perfect fit for both savory and sweet treats. While rhubarb is botanically defined as a vegetable, a New York court decided in 1947 that it would be classified as a fruit for distribution and regulation purposes. Perhaps for this reason, strawberry rhubarb pie became the most commonly associated recipe. But cooks today are finding other culinary uses for this crimson colored, crisp ingredient and it’s ending up in jams, soups, salsas, and stews.",

They grow well on fences and walls, and are not as prone to pests and diseases as raspberries. The tayberry has a slightly tart flavor.",
